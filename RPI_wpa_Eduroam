Setting up WICD
To use WICD, you need to create a suitable template and then activate it.

1. Create the template by copying the below in to a new file in your WICD encryption templates directory e.g. /etc/wicd/encryption/templates/bristol-eduroam

name = Bristol-Eduroam
author = Bristol Wireless Team
version = 1
require bristol_username *Bristol_Username bristol_password *Bristol_Password ca_cert *Path_to_CA_Cert
-----
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
network={
        ssid="$_ESSID"
        scan_ssid=$_SCAN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        proto=WPA RSN
        pairwise=CCMP TKIP
        group=CCMP TKIP
        eap=TTLS
        identity="$_BRISTOL_USERNAME"
        password="$_BRISTOL_PASSWORD"
        anonymous_identity="@bristol.ac.uk"
        ca_cert="$_CA_CERT"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}

2. Activate the profile by adding the name of the template file bristol-eduroam to 
the list in the active templates file: /etc/wicd/encryption/templates/active

3. When connecting using WICD, be sure to select the Bristol-Eduroam template. 
The Path to CA Cert field should be the location of the Bristol Net CA Certificate file on your computer. 
You can get the Bristol Net CA Certificate file from:

https://www.wireless.bris.ac.uk/certs/eaproot/uob-net-ca.crt
