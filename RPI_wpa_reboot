How do you get the raspberry pi to connect to the wifi router after setting the ssid/password without rebooting. In older versions I just used 'sudo ifdown wlan0; sudo ifup wlan0' but ifupdown is not supported on stretch.

I have tried each of the following, none of which have work:
Code: Select all

sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.service
sudo systemctl restart networking.service
sudo service networking restart

wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure
